		<p>imulation are given as follows: time step size ∆t = 0.00001, the slope of nonlinearity in the sigmoid function u0 = 0.01, and the iteration number is 100. In each experiment, the HNN can converge to a valid solution after 100 it- erations. Our method to obtain a solution at the stable state is that the 4 routes whose corresponding neurons have the largest values are determined to be the final alternative routes.
We have done 20 experiments and a valid solution is obtained in each experiment. The good stability of our al- gorithm is demonstrated in two aspects. First from thevalue of the objective function computed in each experiment, as shown in Fig. 3. We see that the dynamic range of the objective function is very small (< ±0.045% ). Second, we have also noted that there is little difference between the routes included in two distinct solutions.

We choose the best solution in Fig. 3, and thus obtain the finally selected alternative routes (not shown due to limited space).
6.3. Neural computation for optimal routing
Now we use the neural computation approach presented in Section 4 to solve the optimal routing problem.
As stated earlier, when the NN converges to a stable state, the output Vij of the neuron ij denotes the portion of the flow of commodity i that will be transmitted over the the jth alternative route. Thus as long as we get a solu- tion, the average time delay corresponding to this solution can be calculated in terms of (7). However, two issues must be clarified in the calculation. First, when the NN converges, constraint (10a) may be not strictly satisfied.

R i
Therefore, after we get a solution, Vij is normalized in terms of Vij = Vij / ∑Vij . Second, when we formulate a j
practical solution, i.e. to calculate how many packets should be distributed to each alternativ</p>
